  Discountable protocol used by cashier module.

  When you invoke the apply function in the `Cashier.t()` module like
  `Discountable.apply()` the first argument is a discount type that needs to
  implement this protocol.

  For example, the expression:

      Discount.apply(%Cashier.Discount.OneFor{}, [])

  Invokes `Discountable.apply/2` to compute the discount to be applied to the
  checkout for a specific product code. `Discountable.apply/2` returns a `Cashier.t()`.

  applied. It will contain different parameters depending on the behaviour:

    * `:from`     - bulk discounts, from which product count should discount.
